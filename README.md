# AIRENA - AI Resilience & Empowerment Navigator

## Overview

AIRENA is a web-based platform designed to empower individuals‚Äîespecially youth and marginalized communities‚Äîto critically engage with AI-driven content. It combines AI literacy education with interactive Media & Information Literacy (MIL) training, helping users identify misinformation, biases, and ethical concerns arising from AI systems.

## Core Features

### üéØ AI Transparency Simulator
Interactive module that shows how AI algorithms work through "what-if" scenarios, demonstrating how inputs reshape outputs.

### üõ°Ô∏è FactShield AI Fact-Checker
AI-powered tool to verify news, images, and videos with transparent reasoning explanations.

### üéÆ Gamified Learning Path
Bite-sized lessons on AI literacy and MIL with quizzes, mini-games, and reward badges.

### üë• Community Collaboration Hub
Discussion spaces for users to share experiences and build collective resilience against misinformation.

### üåç Inclusive Design
Offline-ready content, multilingual support, and culturally relevant examples for marginalized communities.
